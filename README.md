# Matrix Implementation
## Why?
Well, I decided to write these 130-ish lines of code just because I wanted to learn how to use matrices better. Also, I wanted to handle them with more abstraction than procedurally with a 2D array.

Read the comments in matrix.cpp to understand how to use the class. I am new to making documentation, but open to suggestions on making my project more understandable.
