# Matrix Implementation
**Current Version:** 0.2

## Why?
Well, I decided to write this code because I wanted to learn how to use matrices better. Also, I wanted to handle them with more abstraction than procedurally with a 2D array.

Read the comments in matrix.h to understand how to use the class. I am new to making documentation, but open to suggestions on making my project more understandable.
